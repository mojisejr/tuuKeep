# Current Focus: Task 1.2 - Randomness Utility Contract

## Status: Starting Implementation

### Objective
Implement `Utils/Randomness.sol` contract with secure on-chain pseudo-randomness for gacha mechanics.

### Key Deliverables
- Secure random number generation using block data
- Protection against miner manipulation
- Gas-efficient implementation
- Permissioned access control for authorized consumer contracts

### Technical Approach
- **Access Control Pattern**: Role-based permissions with `CONSUMER_ROLE`
- **Randomness Source**: Block hash + timestamp + nonce for manipulation resistance
- **Gas Optimization**: View functions where possible, efficient entropy mixing
- **Security**: Multiple entropy sources, commit-reveal consideration

### Dependencies
- Task 1.1: Project Setup âœ… COMPLETED
- Hardhat 3.0 environment ready
- Solidity 0.8.28 compilation working

### Next Steps
1. Create `contracts/contracts/Utils/Randomness.sol`
2. Implement core randomness generation logic
3. Add access control with OpenZeppelin
4. Create comprehensive test suite
5. Gas optimization analysis

### Session Context
- Working from `/docs/contract-plan.md` Task 1.2 specification
- Previous session completed Task 1.1 setup with Node.js v22.18.0 upgrade
- Identified need for permissioned access vs public functions
- Ready to begin implementation phase
