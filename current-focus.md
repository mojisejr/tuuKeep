- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.3 (Security Libraries & Utilities)

## Implementation Focus
Building the core TuuCoin token contract that will serve as the platform's native token:
1. Standard ERC-20 implementation with OpenZeppelin base
2. Controlled minting mechanism for platform economy
3. Burn functionality for gacha odds improvement
4. Role-based access control for administrative functions
