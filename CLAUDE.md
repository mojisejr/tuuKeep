## Project Overview

**Project Name**: TuuKeep - Decentralized Gachapon Platform

**Repository**: https://github.com/user/tookeep-kub

**Description**: TuuKeep is a Decentralized Gachapon (TuuKeep) platform built on the blockchain, allowing users to own **Gachapon Cabinet NFTs**. These NFTs are not just collectibles; they are income-generating assets. Cabinet owners can fill their machines with various assets, including other NFTs and crypto tokens, and open them up for players to pay and receive a random item.

**Project Goals**:

- Create a fun NFT gaming platform with a sustainable and engaging economic model
- Generate revenue from selling **Gachapon Cabinet NFTs** and collecting transaction fees from gacha plays
- Build a decentralized ecosystem where cabinet owners earn from their assets
- Provide an engaging gaming experience with blockchain-based randomness and asset management

### Development Guidelines

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Synchronize Time Before Any File Operations**

Before creating a new file or saving any timestamps, you **MUST** use the following command to retrieve the current date and time from the system:

```bash
date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
```

This ensures accurate timestamp synchronization with the system clock and prevents time-related inconsistencies.

#### File Naming Conventions

- **Retrospective Files**: `session-YYYY-MM-DD-[description].md`
- **Log Files**: `YYYY-MM-DD-[type].log`
- **Backup Files**: `backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.sql`

#### Important Notes

- **ALL timestamps** in documentation, logs, and file names must use Thailand timezone
- **Year format** must always be Christian Era (‡∏Ñ.‡∏®.) not Buddhist Era (‡∏û.‡∏®.)
- **Development sessions** should reference Thailand local time
- **Retrospective files** must use correct Thailand date in filename

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

### NEVER MERGE PRS YOURSELF

**DO NOT** use any commands to merge Pull Requests, such as `gh pr merge`. Your role is to create a well-documented PR and provide the link to the user.

**ONLY** provide the PR link to the user and **WAIT** for explicit user instruction to merge. The user will review and merge when ready.

### DO NOT DELETE CRITICAL FILES

You are **FORBIDDEN** from deleting or moving critical files and directories in the project. This includes, but is not limited to: `.env`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, and the main project root files. If a file or directory needs to be removed, you must explicitly ask for user permission and provide a clear explanation.

### HANDLE SENSITIVE DATA WITH CARE

You must **NEVER** include sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or user data in any commit messages, Pull Request descriptions, or public logs. Always use environment variables for sensitive data. If you detect sensitive data, you must alert the user and **REFUSE** to proceed until the information is properly handled.

**Critical Environment Variables**:

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Wallet private key for contract deployment
- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID`: Infura API key for blockchain connectivity
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: For contract verification
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: WalletConnect configuration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_CABINET`: Deployed cabinet contract address
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_TUUCOIN`: Deployed TuuCoin contract address

### STICK TO THE SCOPE

You are instructed to focus **ONLY** on the task described in the assigned Issue. Do not perform any refactoring, code cleanup, or new feature development unless it is explicitly part of the plan. If you encounter an opportunity to improve the code outside of the current scope, you must create a new task and discuss it with the user first.

### SMART CONTRACT SAFETY

**DO NOT** deploy smart contracts to mainnet without thorough testing on testnet. Always verify contract addresses and test all functions on testnet before mainnet deployment. Any changes to contract logic must be thoroughly tested using Hardhat test suite (`npx hardhat test`).

## üöÄ Development Workflows

### The Two-Issue Pattern

This project uses a Two-Issue Pattern to separate work context from actionable plans, integrating local workflows with GitHub Issues for clarity and traceability.

- **Context Issues (`=fcs`):** Used to record the current state and context of a session on GitHub.

- **Task Issues (`=plan`):** Used to create a detailed and comprehensive plan of action on GitHub. The agent will use information from the latest Context Issue as a reference.

---

### Shortcut Commands

These commands are standard across all projects and streamline our communication with **AUTOMATED WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**.

- **`=fcs > [message]`**: Updates the `current-focus.md` file on the local machine and creates a **GitHub Context Issue** with the specified `[message]` as the title. **WARNING**: This command will only work if there are no open GitHub issues. If there are, the agent will alert you to clear the backlog before you can save a new context. To bypass this check, use the command `=fcs -f > [message]`.

- **`=plan > [question/problem]`**: Creates a **GitHub Task Issue** with a detailed and comprehensive plan of action. **ENHANCED WITH CODEBASE ANALYSIS** - The agent will:

  1. **Codebase Analysis Phase**: For non-new feature implementations (fixes, refactors, modifications):

     - Search and analyze all relevant code components and dependencies
     - Identify side effects and interconnected systems
     - Review existing patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
     - Map data flow and component relationships
     - Assess impact on related functionality

  2. **Plan Creation Phase**: Use all gathered information including:
     - Current focus context from `current-focus.md`
     - Previous conversation history
     - Comprehensive codebase analysis results
     - Identified dependencies and side effects

  If an open Task Issue already exists, the agent will **update** that Issue with the latest information instead of creating a new one.

- **`=impl > [message]`**: **ENHANCED WITH AUTOMATED WORKFLOW** - Instructs the agent to execute the plan contained in the latest **GitHub Task Issue** with full automation:

  1. **Auto-Branch Creation**: Creates feature branch with proper naming (`feature/[issue-number]-[description]`)
  2. **Implementation**: Executes the planned work
  3. **Auto-Commit & Push**: Commits changes with descriptive messages and pushes to remote
  4. **Auto-PR Creation**: Creates Pull Request with proper description and issue references
  5. **Issue Updates**: Updates the plan issue with PR link and completion status
  6. **User Notification**: Provides PR link for review and approval

- **`=rrr > [message]`**: Creates a daily Retrospective file in the `docs/retrospective/` folder and creates a GitHub Issue containing a summary of the work, an AI Diary, and Honest Feedback, allowing you and the team to review the session accurately.

### üîÑ Plan Issue Management Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: For large, multi-phase projects, the agent must **UPDATE** existing plan issues instead of creating new ones.

- **When completing phases**: Update the plan issue to reflect completed phases and mark them as ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Progress tracking**: Update the issue description with current status, next steps, and any blockers
- **Phase completion**: When a phase is finished, update the plan issue immediately before moving to the next phase
- **Never create new issues**: For ongoing multi-phase work, always update the existing plan issue (#20 for current system refactor)
- **Retrospective issues**: Only create retrospective issues for session summaries, not for plan updates

### üéØ Enhanced Implementation Workflows

#### Multi-Phase Implementation Strategy

**Proven 5-Phase Approach** (15-34 minute sessions):

1. **Analysis & Preparation** (5-8 min): Component analysis, dependency mapping

2. **Trace Data Structures**: Follow interface definitions through the codebase
3. **Validate Field Names**: Don't assume field naming conventions
4. **Check Relationships**: Understand model relationships before querying

#### Common Schema Pitfalls

- **Assumption Errors**: Making assumptions about field names/structures
- **Interface Misalignment**: Frontend interfaces not matching database schema
- **Relationship Complexity**: Not understanding foreign key relationships
- **Type Mismatches**: TypeScript interfaces not reflecting actual data structures

### üîß Multi-Phase Implementation Approach

#### Systematic Phase Breakdown

- **Phase 1**: Analysis & Preparation (10-15%)
- **Phase 2**: Core Implementation (40-50%)
- **Phase 3**: Integration & Testing (25-30%)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation & Cleanup (10-15%)

#### Phase Management Best Practices

- **Clear Phase Objectives**: Define specific deliverables for each phase
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify cross-phase dependencies upfront
- **Progress Checkpoints**: Validate phase completion before proceeding
- **Issue Tracking**: Update GitHub issues after each phase completion

### üîí Smart Contract Best Practices

#### Contract Security Guidelines

- **Access Control**: Implement proper owner/admin controls for sensitive functions
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Use ReentrancyGuard for functions handling external calls
- **Integer Overflow**: Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimize storage operations and external calls

#### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each contract function in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Gas Analysis**: Monitor gas usage and optimize expensive operations

### üìù Documentation Standards

#### PR Description Requirements

- **Implementation Summary**: Clear overview of changes made
- **Technical Details**: Specific technical implementation notes
- **Before/After Analysis**: Impact assessment and improvement metrics
- **Testing Validation**: Build success and functionality verification

#### Retrospective Documentation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Check for type errors or syntax issues
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "error"

# Clear cache and reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules .next .cache
npm install

# Reset Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

#### Contract Deployment Issues

```bash
# Clean and recompile contracts
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat compile

# Check deployment script
node scripts/deploy.js

# Verify contract on testnet first
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

#### Smart Contract Issues

**Common Contract Deployment Issues:**

- Gas estimation failures during deployment
- Contract verification failures on Etherscan
- ABI mismatch between frontend and deployed contracts
- Network configuration problems

**Diagnosis and Resolution:**

- Check gas prices: Use tools like ETH Gas Station for current rates
- Verify network configuration in Hardhat config
- Regenerate contract types after redeployment: `npx typechain`
- Test on local network first: `npx hardhat node`

**Prevention strategies:**

- Always test contracts thoroughly on local network
- Use consistent compiler versions across environments
- Maintain proper contract verification scripts
- Keep deployment addresses organized per network

#### Web3 Integration Errors

_Contract ABI and type safety are critical for Web3 applications_

**Common Integration Issues:**

- **ABI Sync**: `npx typechain --target ethers-v5 --out-dir types/contracts`
- **Type Validation**: `npm run build && npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Contract Types**: Regenerate types after contract redeployment

**Web3 Integration Protocol:**

1. **Never assume contract addresses** - Always verify deployed addresses
2. **Trace contract interactions** - Follow transaction flows through wagmi hooks
3. **Verify network compatibility** - Check contract deployment on target networks
4. **Test incremental changes** - Run build after each Web3 integration change

**Common pitfalls**: Stale contract addresses, outdated ABIs, network mismatches

#### Web3 Connection Issues

```bash
# Check wallet connection
# Verify MetaMask is installed and connected
# Ensure correct network is selected

# Check contract addresses
echo "Verify deployed contract addresses match frontend configuration"

# Test contract interactions
# Use Hardhat console for contract debugging
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

#### Port Conflicts

```bash
# Find the process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 [PID]

# Use alternative port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

#### Blockchain Network Issues

```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Verify wallet balance
# Check if wallet has sufficient ETH for gas fees

# Test transaction simulation
# Use tools like Tenderly for transaction debugging
```

#### Security Implementation Issues

_From comprehensive security audit retrospectives_

**Rate Limiting Configuration Missing:**

- Check patterns in `src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`
- API config: `{ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }`
- Admin config: `{ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 20 }`

**Webhook Security Hardening:**

- Never log webhook secrets in error messages
- Use generic error responses to prevent information disclosure
- Implement timestamp-based replay protection (5-minute window)
- Use `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` for signature validation

**Input Validation Enhancement:**

- Implement comprehensive Zod schemas for all API endpoints
- Example: Payment validation with amount limits, currency restrictions, UUID validation

#### System Integration Issues

_From reward configuration and campaign implementation sessions_

**RewardConfiguration Integration:**

- Always check existing database records first: `npx prisma studio --port 5555`
- Create temporary validation scripts for testing database operations
- Use `PrismaClient` for isolated testing of specific queries

**Campaign System Testing:**

- Test campaign eligibility detection
- Verify PaymentHistory queries for first payment detection
- Validate campaign discount application in Stripe integration
- Debug with API calls to campaign endpoints

#### Visual Design and Accessibility Issues

_From UI/UX refactoring sessions_

**Color Contrast and Accessibility Problems:**

- Use automated contrast checking tools
- Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
- Test with screen readers when possible
- Check banner text readability and promotional element contrast
- Test reduced motion preferences

**Styling System Conflicts:**

- Avoid duplication with centralized utilities
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for styling configs
- Follow existing component patterns and design tokens
- Use `src/utils/campaignStyles.ts` and `src/components/common/`

#### Database Migration and Schema Issues

_From database migration and system reset sessions_

**Migration Safety Protocol:**

- Always create comprehensive backups before major changes
- Preserve critical data (Card and Prompt tables)
- Use timestamped backup files: `backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M).db`
- Use `npx prisma db seed` for critical data restoration

**Schema Assumptions Prevention:**

- Never assume field names without verification
- Always check actual Prisma schema definitions
- Trace data structures through the entire codebase
- Use `grep` commands to trace field usage across codebase

### Performance Monitoring

- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP (<2.5s), FID (<100ms), CLS (<0.1)
- **Transaction Times**: Monitor blockchain transaction confirmation times
- **Gas Usage**: Track and optimize contract gas consumption
- **Web3 Connection**: Monitor wallet connection reliability and RPC response times
- **Contract Interaction**: Track success rates of contract function calls
- **Error Rates**: Monitor failed transactions and connection issues
